# Team Science Training: Detailed Facilitator Guide

## Pre-Session Preparation

### Room Setup
**In-Person:**

- Tables for 4-6 people (collaborative seating)
- Wall space for posting flipchart sheets
- Supplies: markers, sticky notes, timer, flipchart paper
- Name tags with first names only

**Virtual:**

- Pre-configured breakout rooms (4-5 people each)
- Shared collaboration tool (Miro, Jamboard, or Padlet)
- Polls/surveys ready in platform
- Chat moderation plan

### Facilitator Mindset

- **You're a guide, not a guru:** Your science expertise gives you credibility, but participants' experiences drive learning
- **Embrace productive discomfort:** Some activities may feel unfamiliar - that's intentional
- **Model vulnerability:** Share your own collaboration challenges when appropriate

---

## Module 1: Foundations of Team Science (30 minutes)

### Content Block: What Makes Teams Work (15 minutes)

#### Opening Hook (3 minutes)
**Say:** "Raise your hand if you've ever been part of a research collaboration that felt effortless and productive." [Pause for hands] "Keep your hand up if you've been part of one that was frustrating or unproductive." [Usually more hands go up]

**Transition:** "Today we're going to unpack why some collaborations soar while others struggle, using evidence from the science of team science itself."

#### Key Message 1: The Collaboration Imperative (4 minutes)
**Data to Share:**

- 2007 study of 19.9 million papers showed teams produce higher-impact research
- Nobel Prize data: 42% of physics prizes since 2000 went to collaborations
- NIH success rates higher for multi-PI grants in many programs

**Discussion Prompt:** "What drives this trend toward collaboration in your field?"

**Listen for:** Complexity of problems, resource needs, interdisciplinary requirements, technology demands

**Bridge:** "But collaboration isn't automatically better - it has to be done well."

#### Key Message 2: When Teams Fail (4 minutes)
**Common Failure Modes (present as bullets on slide):**

- **Coordination loss:** Too much time spent organizing, not enough creating
- **Social loafing:** Some members contribute less in group settings
- **Groupthink:** Pressure for consensus stifles critical thinking
- **Process conflict:** Disagreements about how to work together
- **Goal misalignment:** Different objectives or success metrics

**Facilitator Note:** Don't dwell on failures - this sets up the solution-focused content ahead.

#### Key Message 3: Success Factors (4 minutes)
**The IMPACT Framework:**

- **I**nterdependence: Members need each other to succeed
- **M**otivation: Shared purpose and individual engagement
- **P**rocesses: Clear workflows and communication protocols
- **A**bilities: Complementary skills and expertise
- **C**ulture: Trust, psychological safety, inclusion norms
- **T**ools: Infrastructure for collaboration and data sharing

**Facilitator Tip:** This framework threads through the entire training - refer back to it throughout.

### Activity 1: Team Science Assessment (15 minutes)

#### Individual Reflection (5 minutes)
**Instructions to Give:**
"Think of a research collaboration you've been part of - current or recent. Rate it on these six dimensions using a 1-5 scale, where 1 is 'major weakness' and 5 is 'major strength.' Be honest - this is for your learning."

**Dimensions to Rate:**

1. **Clear shared goals:** Everyone understood what we were trying to achieve
2. **Complementary expertise:** Team had the right mix of skills and knowledge
3. **Effective communication:** Information flowed well, meetings were productive
4. **Equitable participation:** All voices were heard, contributions were valued
5. **Conflict resolution:** We handled disagreements constructively
6. **Resource sharing:** Data, materials, and tools were accessible to team members

**Facilitator Actions:**

- Walk around, but don't look over shoulders
- Give 1-minute and 30-second warnings
- Model reflection by jotting your own notes

#### Small Group Discussion (10 minutes)
**Instructions:**
"Form groups of 4-5. Each person shares:
1. One area where your team was strongest (highest score)
2. One area that was most challenging (lowest score)
3. Don't name the team or people - focus on the dynamics"

**Your Role:**

- Visit each group briefly, listen for patterns
- Note common strengths and challenges on your notepad
- Prepare to synthesize themes in debrief

**Listen for These Patterns:**

- **Strengths:** Often include shared excitement about the problem, clear expertise divisions, strong PI leadership
- **Challenges:** Frequently communication breakdowns, unclear roles, data sharing difficulties, conflict avoidance

#### Debrief (5 minutes)
**Process:**

1. "What themes did you hear in your groups about team strengths?"
2. "What about common challenges?"
3. Capture responses on flipchart/screen
4. "Great - we're going to address many of these challenges directly in our time together"

**Transition:** "Let's start with one of the most commonly cited issues: communication."

---

## Module 2: Communication Architecture (45 minutes)

### Content Block: Evidence-Based Communication Strategies (20 minutes)

#### Opening Bridge (2 minutes)
**Say:** "In that last activity, how many groups mentioned communication as a challenge?" [Show of hands] "Communication issues aren't just annoying - they're expensive. MIT research shows that poor communication costs organizations an average of $62.4 million per year."

#### The 4C Framework Introduction (3 minutes)
**Present Framework:**
"Effective team communication has four essential elements - the 4 C's:"

**Clarity | Cadence | Channels | Culture**

"Let's unpack each one with some science behind it."

#### Clarity: Structured Information Sharing (4 minutes)
**Research Basis:** Hackman's research on team design shows that clarity of purpose and process predicts team success better than member characteristics.

**Practical Application:**

- **Meeting agendas with time allocations**
- **Decision logs** (what was decided, by whom, when)
- **Action items with owners and deadlines**
- **Shared glossaries** for technical terms across disciplines

**Discussion Prompt:** "What happens in your experience when roles or expectations aren't clear?"

**Listen for:** Duplicated work, missed deadlines, conflict, frustration

#### Cadence: Regular, Predictable Touchpoints (3 minutes)
**Research Basis:** Gersick's punctuated equilibrium model shows teams need regular check-ins to maintain momentum and adjust course.

**Practical Framework:**

- **Daily/Weekly:** Tactical coordination (brief, operational)
- **Bi-weekly/Monthly:** Strategic review (longer, reflective)
- **Quarterly:** Relationship maintenance (team building, big picture)
- **As-needed:** Crisis management (rapid response protocols)

**Key Point:** "Consistency matters more than frequency. Better to have monthly meetings that always happen than weekly ones that get cancelled."

#### Channels: Right Medium for the Message (4 minutes)
**Research Basis:** Media richness theory - different types of information need different communication channels.

**Channel Selection Guide:**

- **Face-to-face/Video:** Complex discussions, sensitive topics, brainstorming
- **Phone:** Quick decisions, relationship building
- **Email:** Documentation, detailed information sharing, non-urgent items
- **Chat/Slack:** Quick questions, coordination, social connection
- **Shared documents:** Collaborative creation, version control

**Common Mistake:** "Using email for everything. Email is terrible for discussions but great for decisions."

#### Culture: Psychological Safety and Inclusion (4 minutes)
**Research Basis:** Google's Project Aristotle found psychological safety was the #1 predictor of team performance.

**Edmondson's Definition:** "A shared belief that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking."

**Observable Behaviors:**

- People ask questions without fear of appearing ignorant
- Mistakes are discussed openly as learning opportunities
- Disagreement is expressed respectfully and directly
- Different perspectives are actively sought

**Key Insight:** "This doesn't mean being 'nice' all the time - it means being direct and kind simultaneously."

### Activity 2: Communication Charter Workshop (25 minutes)

#### Setup and Instructions (3 minutes)
**Form Teams:** "Count off 1-5, find your number group. You're going to create a communication charter that a real research team could use."

**Materials:** Provide charter template, example excerpts, channel decision tree

#### Phase 1: Charter Development (10 minutes)
**Instructions to Teams:**
"Imagine you're starting a 2-year collaborative research project. Create a communication charter addressing these areas:"

**Charter Elements:**
1. **Communication Values** (3-4 core principles)
2. **Meeting Rhythms** (frequency, duration, purpose of different meeting types)
3. **Channel Guidelines** (what goes where, response time expectations)
4. **Decision-Making Process** (how choices get made, who has input vs. final say)
5. **Conflict Resolution** (steps for handling disagreements)

**Your Role as Facilitator:**

- Circulate between teams
- Ask clarifying questions: "How would this work in practice?" "What if someone doesn't follow this?"
- Keep energy up with time calls
- Look for innovative approaches to highlight

**Common Sticking Points and Responses:**

- **"This is too rigid"** → "Think of it as a default, not a rule. You can always deviate with agreement"
- **"Our team is different"** → "Absolutely - customize this to your context"
- **"We don't have time for all these meetings"** → "What's the cost of poor coordination?"

#### Phase 2: Peer Feedback (10 minutes)
**Process:**
1. Teams pair up and exchange charters
2. Each team provides feedback using this structure:
   - **One strength:** What works well in this charter?
   - **One question:** What needs clarification?
   - **One suggestion:** How could this be improved or strengthened?

**Feedback Guidelines to Share:**

- Be specific rather than general
- Focus on workability, not personal preferences
- Ask questions if something is unclear

**Your Role:**

- Monitor feedback quality - intervene if it's too vague or harsh
- Help teams stay on time
- Note particularly creative solutions for later sharing

#### Phase 3: Revision (2 minutes)
"Take the feedback you received and make one concrete revision to your charter."

**Why This Matters:** Teams that practice giving and receiving feedback in low-stakes situations do better when conflicts arise.

## Module 3: Governance and Leadership Models (40 minutes)

### Content Block: Governance Structures That Work (20 minutes)

#### Opening Connection (2 minutes)
**Say:** "Communication helps teams work day-to-day, but governance determines how teams make big decisions and handle authority. Let's look at what research tells us about structures that actually work."

#### Governance vs. Management Distinction (3 minutes)
**Key Distinction:**

- **Management:** Day-to-day operations, task coordination, resource allocation
- **Governance:** Decision rights, accountability structures, conflict resolution, strategic direction

**Why It Matters:** "Many teams focus only on management and wonder why they struggle with bigger decisions."

#### Model 1: Distributed Leadership (4 minutes)
**Core Principle:** Different people lead different aspects based on expertise and interest.

**Research Support:** Pearce & Conger's studies show distributed leadership increases team performance in knowledge work.

**Structure Example:**

- **Scientific Leadership:** Domain expert guides research direction
- **Operational Leadership:** Project manager handles logistics, timelines
- **External Leadership:** Senior person manages stakeholder relationships
- **Innovation Leadership:** Creative thinker drives new approaches

**Pros:** Leverages expertise, develops multiple people, reduces single points of failure
**Cons:** Can be confusing if roles aren't clear, may slow some decisions

**When It Works Best:** Diverse, highly skilled teams with complex projects

#### Model 2: Rotating Leadership (3 minutes)
**Core Principle:** Leadership rotates based on project phase or expertise needs.

**Real Example:** "In the Human Genome Project, different institutions led different phases based on their comparative advantages."

**Structure Example:**

- **Phase 1:** Data collection led by field research expert
- **Phase 2:** Analysis led by computational specialist
- **Phase 3:** Dissemination led by policy expert

**Pros:** Matches expertise to needs, develops multiple leaders
**Cons:** Requires smooth handoffs, can create discontinuity

#### Model 3: Collaborative Hierarchy (4 minutes)
**Core Principle:** Clear hierarchy with democratic input mechanisms.

**Research Support:** Tannenbaum & Schmidt's leadership continuum research shows this balances efficiency with engagement.

**Structure Example:**

- **Principal Investigator:** Final decision authority, external accountability
- **Advisory Council:** Representative input from all stakeholder groups
- **Working Groups:** Delegated authority for specific domains

**Decision Process:**

1. Working groups develop recommendations
2. Advisory council provides input and alternatives
3. PI makes final decision with transparent rationale

**Pros:** Clear accountability, incorporates diverse input, efficient
**Cons:** Can feel top-down if not implemented well

#### Model 4: Network Governance (4 minutes)
**Core Principle:** Hub-and-spoke coordination across autonomous units.

**Real Example:** "Think of how the Large Hadron Collider collaboration works - thousands of scientists across hundreds of institutions."

**Structure:**

- **Central Coordination Hub:** Manages overall project, standards, resources
- **Autonomous Nodes:** Independent teams with specific responsibilities
- **Liaison Roles:** Boundary spanners who connect nodes

**Pros:** Scales to large collaborations, maintains autonomy
**Cons:** Complex coordination, potential for fragmentation

**Key Success Factor:** Strong coordination mechanisms and shared standards

### Activity 3: Governance Design Challenge (20 minutes)

#### Scenario Assignment (2 minutes)
**Four Scenarios - Assign One Per Team:**

1. **Multi-institutional Clinical Trial**
   - 5 medical centers, 200 patients, 3-year timeline
   - Regulatory compliance requirements, patient safety critical
   - $2M budget, industry sponsor

2. **Interdisciplinary Data Analysis Consortium**
   - Computer scientists, social scientists, domain experts
   - Large shared dataset, multiple research questions
   - Different publication norms across disciplines

3. **International Field Research Collaboration**
   - Teams from 4 countries, remote field sites
   - Equipment sharing, varying resource levels
   - Different institutional policies and cultures

4. **Industry-Academic Partnership**
   - University researchers + company R&D team
   - Proprietary data concerns, different timelines
   - Academic freedom vs. commercial interests

#### Design Phase (15 minutes)
**Instructions to Teams:**
"Design a governance structure for your scenario. Address these key elements:"

**Governance Elements to Address:**

1. **Leadership Structure:** Who has authority for what decisions?
2. **Decision-Making Process:** How are key choices made?
3. **Conflict Resolution:** What happens when people disagree?
4. **Resource Allocation:** How are shared resources managed?
5. **Credit and Recognition:** How are contributions acknowledged?

**Deliverable:** Create a visual representation (flowchart, org chart, process diagram) that shows your governance model.

**Your Facilitation Approach:**

- **Visit each team twice during the 15 minutes**
- **First visit (5-7 min):** Check understanding, clarify scenario details
- **Second visit (10-12 min):** Push thinking with questions:
  - "What happens if this person leaves the project?"
  - "How do you handle a major disagreement using this structure?"
  - "Where might this break down under pressure?"

**Common Challenges and Responses:**

- **Teams default to simple hierarchy** → "What are the downsides of that approach for this scenario?"
- **Teams create overly complex structures** → "How would new team members understand this?"
- **Teams ignore the human dynamics** → "What about trust, communication, relationships?"

#### Gallery Walk and Voting (3 minutes)
**Process:**

1. Teams post their governance designs around the room
2. Everyone walks around and reviews all designs
3. Each person gets 2 dot stickers to vote for:
   - Most innovative approach
   - Most practical for real implementation

**Debrief Questions:**

- "What patterns do you see across the designs?"
- "What creative solutions surprised you?"
- "What would make these governance models actually work in practice?"

## Module 4: Data Sharing and Resource Management (35 minutes)

### Content Block: Collaborative Data Practices (15 minutes)

#### Opening Reality Check (2 minutes)
**Ask:** "How many of you have been part of a collaboration where data sharing was seamless and easy?" [Few hands usually go up]

**Say:** "Data sharing is often the biggest practical barrier to effective collaboration. Let's look at frameworks that make it work."

#### The FAIR+ Framework (4 minutes)
**Present Framework:** "The FAIR principles were designed for open science, but we need to extend them for collaborative team science."

**FAIR Principles:**

- **F**indable: Team members can locate relevant data and resources
- **A**ccessible: Appropriate permissions and access protocols exist
- **I**nteroperable: Data works across different systems and analyses
- **R**eusable: Clear documentation enables future use

**The '+' Addition:**

- **Secure:** Privacy, confidentiality, and compliance protections

#### Findable: Shared Repositories and Metadata (2 minutes)
**Common Problem:** "The data exists somewhere, but no one can find it when they need it."

**Solutions:**

- **Central registry** of all project datasets with descriptions
- **Consistent naming conventions** for files and versions
- **Metadata templates** that everyone uses
- **Search functionality** within shared repositories

**Quick Example:** "Instead of 'Analysis_final_v3_JMS.xlsx', use '2024-03-15_participant-survey_cleaned_smith.xlsx'"

#### Accessible: Permission Systems (3 minutes)
**Key Principle:** "Default to open within the team, closed to the outside, with explicit exceptions."

**Access Levels:**

- **Full Access:** Core team members, can read/write/modify
- **Analysis Access:** Can download and analyze, cannot modify originals  
- **Metadata Access:** Can see what exists, request specific datasets
- **No Access:** Sensitive data with special restrictions

**Implementation Tools:**

- **Cloud platforms** with granular permissions (Google Drive, Box, institutional systems)
- **Version control systems** (Git for code, specialized tools for data)
- **Access logging** for sensitive data compliance

#### Interoperable: Compatible Formats (2 minutes)
**Common Failure:** "Everyone saves data in their preferred format, nothing works together."

**Best Practices:**

- **Agreed-upon file formats** for different data types
- **Standard variable naming** across datasets
- **Common coding schemes** for categorical variables
- **Documentation templates** that everyone uses

#### Reusable: Documentation and Licensing (2 minutes)
**The Documentation Imperative:** "If you can't understand the data 6 months from now, no one else will either."

**Essential Documentation:**

- **Data collection protocols** and any changes over time
- **Variable definitions** and coding schemes
- **Quality control procedures** and known limitations
- **Analysis scripts** with comments explaining logic

### Activity 4: Data Sharing Agreement Simulation (20 minutes)

#### Role Assignment and Scenario Setup (3 minutes)
**Scenario:** Multi-site study examining social media use and mental health outcomes among adolescents. Site A (major university) has collected data from 500 participants. Site B (smaller college) wants to access this data for secondary analysis.

**Roles (5 people per group):**

1. **Site A Principal Investigator:** Collected the data, protective of participants
2. **Site B Researcher:** Wants access for legitimate secondary research
3. **Site A Compliance Officer:** Responsible for legal/ethical compliance
4. **Site B IRB Representative:** Must ensure ethical standards
5. **Data Manager:** Technical expert on security and systems

**Key Constraints:**

- Data includes sensitive mental health information
- Participants consented to "research by the study team and approved collaborators"
- Site A IRB approval required for data sharing
- Site B has different data security infrastructure

#### Negotiation Phase (15 minutes)
**Instructions to Groups:**
"You have 15 minutes to negotiate a data sharing agreement. You must address these issues:"

**Required Agreement Elements:**

1. **What data can be shared?** (raw data, processed data, aggregate data only?)
2. **Access controls:** How will Site B access and store the data?
3. **Permitted analyses:** What research questions can Site B pursue?
4. **Publication rights:** How are publications handled? Authorship?
5. **Security requirements:** What technical safeguards are needed?
6. **Compliance verification:** How is adherence to agreement monitored?

**Your Facilitation Strategy:**

- **Let tensions emerge naturally** - don't smooth over disagreements too quickly
- **Intervene only if discussion becomes personal** or completely stuck
- **Note common sticking points** for debrief discussion
- **Watch for creative solutions** that balance competing interests

**Common Sticking Points You'll Observe:**

- **Site A wants extensive oversight, Site B wants autonomy**
- **Publication timelines and approval processes**
- **Technical security requirements vs. practical constraints**
- **What happens if Site B violates the agreement**

#### Debrief Discussion (7 minutes)
**Debrief Questions:**

1. "What was hardest to negotiate? Why?"
2. "What solutions did you find for balancing protection with access?"
3. "How did the different perspectives (PI vs. compliance vs. IRB) create tension?"
4. "What would make this process easier in real life?"

**Key Learning Points to Draw Out:**

- **Start data sharing conversations early** in collaboration planning
- **Different stakeholders have legitimate but competing concerns**
- **Technical solutions can resolve some trust issues**
- **Clear agreements prevent bigger conflicts later**
- **Templates and institutional support make negotiations faster**

**Transition:** "Data sharing is often where issues of fairness and inclusion become most visible. Let's talk about building teams where everyone can contribute effectively."

---

## Module 5: Building Inclusive and Productive Teams (30 minutes)

### Content Block: Diversity, Equity, and Team Performance (15 minutes)

#### Opening with Evidence (3 minutes)
**Research Foundation:** "Three key findings from team performance research:"

1. **Diverse teams outperform homogeneous teams** on complex problems (Page 2007)
2. **But diversity alone isn't enough** - inclusion practices determine whether diversity helps or hurts (Nishii 2013)
3. **Small changes in process can have big impacts** on who participates and how (Woolley 2010)

**Key Insight:** "Diversity is about composition. Inclusion is about behavior."

#### Understanding Different Types of Diversity (4 minutes)
**Surface-Level Diversity:**

- Demographics: gender, race, age, nationality
- Disciplinary backgrounds
- Institutional affiliations
- Career stages

**Deep-Level Diversity:**

- Thinking styles (analytical vs. intuitive)
- Work preferences (individual vs. collaborative)
- Communication styles (direct vs. indirect)
- Risk tolerance (conservative vs. experimental)

**Why This Matters:** "Surface-level diversity is what we see first, but deep-level diversity often drives the performance benefits."

#### The Contact Theory Application (3 minutes)
**Allport's Contact Theory:** Under the right conditions, contact between different groups reduces bias and improves collaboration.

**The Right Conditions for Research Teams:**

1. **Equal status** within the collaboration context
2. **Common goals** that require interdependence
3. **Intergroup contact** in cooperative (not competitive) settings
4. **Authority support** for collaborative norms

**Practical Application:** "This means actively creating opportunities for different team members to work together as equals on shared objectives."

#### Inclusion Strategies That Work (5 minutes)
**Strategy 1: Structured Brainstorming**

- **Problem:** Extroverted team members dominate idea generation
- **Solution:** Silent brainstorming → individual sharing → group building

**Strategy 2: Devil's Advocate Protocols**

- **Problem:** Pressure for false consensus
- **Solution:** Assign someone to argue alternative perspectives

**Strategy 3: Multiple Communication Channels**

- **Problem:** Some people don't speak up in meetings
- **Solution:** Combine verbal discussion, written input, and one-on-one check-ins

**Strategy 4: Bias Interruption**

- **Problem:** Unconscious biases affect evaluation of ideas and contributions
- **Solution:** Structured evaluation criteria, diverse review panels

**Strategy 5: Cultural Bridge-Building**

- **Problem:** Different professional cultures have different norms
- **Solution:** Explicit discussion of differences, negotiated team norms

### Activity 5: Inclusion Audit and Action Planning (15 minutes)

#### Individual Assessment (5 minutes)
**Instructions:** "Think about a current or recent research collaboration. Rate how well the team does on each inclusion indicator using a 1-5 scale."

**Inclusion Indicators:**

1. **Diverse representation** in leadership and decision-making roles
2. **Equitable participation** in meetings and discussions
3. **Multiple communication styles** are accommodated and valued
4. **Different perspectives** are actively sought on important decisions
5. **Cultural differences** are acknowledged and leveraged as strengths
6. **Bias mitigation** strategies are used in evaluation and selection processes
7. **Conflict resolution** addresses both task and relationship issues
8. **Recognition and credit** are distributed fairly across contributions

**Facilitator Notes:**

- Walk around but maintain privacy
- Notice if people seem stuck - offer to clarify any indicators
- This should be reflective, not judgmental

#### Pair Planning (10 minutes)
**Partner Assignment:** "Find someone you don't know well or haven't worked with closely."

**Conversation Structure:**
**Round 1 (3 minutes each person):** Share assessment results

- Which areas scored highest? What makes those work well?
- Which areas scored lowest? What barriers do you see?
- Don't problem-solve yet - just understand each other's situations

**Round 2 (4 minutes total):** Collaborative action planning

- Choose 2-3 priority areas for improvement
- Brainstorm specific, actionable strategies
- Consider: What would you try first? What support would you need?

**Facilitation Approach:**
- Circulate to listen for innovative ideas
- Help pairs stay focused on actionable steps
- Note themes for whole-group debrief

**Common Challenges and Responses:**

- **"Our team is already pretty inclusive"** → "That's great! What could you share with other teams?"
- **"These problems are too big for me to solve"** → "What's one small experiment you could try?"
- **"I'm not in a leadership position"** → "What can you influence from your current role?"

---

## Module 6: Implementation and Sustainability (20 minutes)

### Content Block: Making It Stick (10 minutes)

#### The Implementation Challenge (2 minutes)
**Reality Check:** "Research on training effectiveness shows that without deliberate implementation support, people use about 10% of what they learn in programs like this."

**Why Implementation Fails:**
- Return to urgent daily pressures
- Lack of organizational support
- Trying to change too much at once
- No accountability mechanisms

#### The Start Small Strategy (3 minutes)
**Pilot Approach:** "Pick one practice, try it with one team, for one month."

**Examples of Good Starting Points:**

- **Communication:** Implement structured agendas for one regular meeting
- **Governance:** Create decision logs for one ongoing project
- **Data sharing:** Establish naming conventions for one shared folder
- **Inclusion:** Try silent brainstorming in one team meeting

**Why This Works:** Small wins build confidence and demonstrate value before scaling up.

#### Measurement and Iteration (2 minutes)
**Simple Metrics for Team Effectiveness:**

- **Efficiency:** Meeting satisfaction scores, time to decision
- **Innovation:** Number of new ideas generated, creative solutions adopted
- **Relationships:** Trust levels, conflict resolution speed
- **Outcomes:** Progress toward goals, quality of deliverables

**The Learning Mindset:** "Expect that your first attempts won't be perfect. The goal is to learn and improve, not to implement flawlessly."

#### Scaling Thoughtfully (3 minutes)
**Scaling Principles:**

1. **Adapt, don't just adopt:** What works for one team may need modification for another
2. **Build champions:** Find early adopters who can help spread practices
3. **Create systems support:** Templates, training, and infrastructure
4. **Address resistance:** Understand and respond to legitimate concerns

**Common Scaling Mistakes:**

- Mandating practices without buy-in
- Ignoring context differences
- Moving too fast without solidifying early wins

### Activity 6: Personal Action Planning (10 minutes)

#### Action Planning Template (8 minutes)
**Instructions:** "Complete this action plan for yourself. Be specific and realistic."

**Template Elements:**
1. **One thing I'll stop doing** in my research collaborations
   - *Example: Stop sending unclear emails that require multiple follow-ups*

2. **One thing I'll start doing** within the next 30 days
   - *Example: Create a communication charter for my current project team*

3. **One practice I'll advocate for** in my existing teams
   - *Example: Propose using structured brainstorming for our next planning meeting*

4. **My accountability partner** from this session
   - *Name and contact information of someone who will check in with you*

5. **Check-in date** to assess progress
   - *Specific date within 60 days to review how implementation is going*

6. **One resource I need** to make this work
   - *Example: Template for data sharing agreements, support from my department chair*

**Facilitator Role:**

- Circulate to answer questions and provide encouragement
- Help people make their commitments specific and measurable
- Connect people who might be good accountability partners

#### Voluntary Sharing (2 minutes)
**Process:** "Would anyone like to share one commitment with the group? This can help with accountability."

**Why This Works:** Public commitments have higher follow-through rates.

**Facilitation Tips:**

- Don't pressure anyone to share
- Celebrate creative or ambitious commitments
- Note themes across commitments

---

## Post-Session Follow-Up

### Immediate Actions (Day 1)

- Send thank you email with session materials
- Share contact information for accountability partnerships
- Provide resource links and templates

### Short-Term Follow-Up (1 month)

- Brief survey on implementation attempts
- Virtual "office hours" for questions
- Share success stories and challenges

### Long-Term Sustainability (3-6 months)

- Follow-up survey on sustained practice changes
- Advanced workshop for graduates
- Community of practice formation

---

## Troubleshooting Common Facilitation Challenges

### Low Participation
**Symptoms:** Quiet groups, minimal discussion, brief activity outputs
**Interventions:**

- Use smaller groups (3-4 people)
- Provide more structure and specific prompts
- Model vulnerability by sharing your own experiences
- Use anonymous input methods (sticky notes, digital polls)

### Resistance to "Soft Skills"
**Symptoms:** Comments like "This is just common sense" or "We need to focus on the science"
**Responses:**

- Lead with data and evidence
- Connect to concrete research outcomes
- Share failure stories from high-profile collaborations
- Acknowledge their expertise while highlighting collaboration complexity

### Time Management Issues
**Symptoms:** Activities running long, content blocks getting rushed
**Solutions:**

- Use visible timers for all activities
- Give time warnings (5 minutes, 2 minutes, wrap up)
- Have abbreviated versions of activities ready
- Cut content, not activities - the practice is more valuable

### Dominating Participants
**Symptoms:** Same people speaking repeatedly, others withdrawing
**Interventions:**

- Use structured turn-taking ("Each person shares one idea")
- Redirect: "Thank you, John. Sarah, what's your perspective?"
- Address privately during breaks if necessary
- Use written activities to balance participation

### Skepticism About Evidence
**Symptoms:** "That research doesn't apply to our field/situation"
**Responses:**

- Ask for specific context that makes it different
- Find research from their discipline if possible
- Focus on principles rather than specific practices
- Invite them to test and report back

### Technology Failures
**Symptoms:** Platform crashes, connectivity issues, lost materials
**Preparation:**

- Have low-tech backup plans for all activities
- Test technology multiple times before session
- Prepare printed materials as backup
- Designate a tech support person if possible
