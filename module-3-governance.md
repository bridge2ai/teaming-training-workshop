# Module 3: Governance and Leadership Models (40 minutes)

### Content Block: Governance Structures That Work (20 minutes)

#### Opening Connection (2 minutes)
**Say:** "Communication helps teams work day-to-day, but governance determines how teams make big decisions and handle authority. Let's look at what research tells us about structures that actually work."

#### Governance vs. Management Distinction (3 minutes)
**Key Distinction:**

- **Management:** Day-to-day operations, task coordination, resource allocation
- **Governance:** Decision rights, accountability structures, conflict resolution, strategic direction

**Why It Matters:** "Many teams focus only on management and wonder why they struggle with bigger decisions."

#### Model 1: Distributed Leadership (4 minutes)
**Core Principle:** Different people lead different aspects based on expertise and interest.

**Research Support:** Pearce & Conger's studies show distributed leadership increases team performance in knowledge work.

**Structure Example:**

- **Scientific Leadership:** Domain expert guides research direction
- **Operational Leadership:** Project manager handles logistics, timelines
- **External Leadership:** Senior person manages stakeholder relationships
- **Innovation Leadership:** Creative thinker drives new approaches

**Pros:** Leverages expertise, develops multiple people, reduces single points of failure
**Cons:** Can be confusing if roles aren't clear, may slow some decisions

**When It Works Best:** Diverse, highly skilled teams with complex projects

#### Model 2: Rotating Leadership (3 minutes)
**Core Principle:** Leadership rotates based on project phase or expertise needs.

**Real Example:** "In the Human Genome Project, different institutions led different phases based on their comparative advantages."

**Structure Example:**

- **Phase 1:** Data collection led by field research expert
- **Phase 2:** Analysis led by computational specialist
- **Phase 3:** Dissemination led by policy expert

**Pros:** Matches expertise to needs, develops multiple leaders
**Cons:** Requires smooth handoffs, can create discontinuity

#### Model 3: Collaborative Hierarchy (4 minutes)
**Core Principle:** Clear hierarchy with democratic input mechanisms.

**Research Support:** Tannenbaum & Schmidt's leadership continuum research shows this balances efficiency with engagement.

**Structure Example:**

- **Principal Investigator:** Final decision authority, external accountability
- **Advisory Council:** Representative input from all stakeholder groups
- **Working Groups:** Delegated authority for specific domains

**Decision Process:**

1. Working groups develop recommendations
2. Advisory council provides input and alternatives
3. PI makes final decision with transparent rationale

**Pros:** Clear accountability, incorporates diverse input, efficient
**Cons:** Can feel top-down if not implemented well

#### Model 4: Network Governance (4 minutes)
**Core Principle:** Hub-and-spoke coordination across autonomous units.

**Real Example:** "Think of how the Large Hadron Collider collaboration works - thousands of scientists across hundreds of institutions."

**Structure:**

- **Central Coordination Hub:** Manages overall project, standards, resources
- **Autonomous Nodes:** Independent teams with specific responsibilities
- **Liaison Roles:** Boundary spanners who connect nodes

**Pros:** Scales to large collaborations, maintains autonomy
**Cons:** Complex coordination, potential for fragmentation

**Key Success Factor:** Strong coordination mechanisms and shared standards

### Activity 3: Governance Design Challenge (20 minutes)

#### Scenario Assignment (2 minutes)
**Four Scenarios - Assign One Per Team:**

1. **Multi-institutional Clinical Trial**
   - 5 medical centers, 200 patients, 3-year timeline
   - Regulatory compliance requirements, patient safety critical
   - $2M budget, industry sponsor

2. **Interdisciplinary Data Analysis Consortium**
   - Computer scientists, social scientists, domain experts
   - Large shared dataset, multiple research questions
   - Different publication norms across disciplines

3. **International Field Research Collaboration**
   - Teams from 4 countries, remote field sites
   - Equipment sharing, varying resource levels
   - Different institutional policies and cultures

4. **Industry-Academic Partnership**
   - University researchers + company R&D team
   - Proprietary data concerns, different timelines
   - Academic freedom vs. commercial interests

#### Design Phase (15 minutes)
**Instructions to Teams:**
"Design a governance structure for your scenario. Address these key elements:"

**Governance Elements to Address:**

1. **Leadership Structure:** Who has authority for what decisions?
2. **Decision-Making Process:** How are key choices made?
3. **Conflict Resolution:** What happens when people disagree?
4. **Resource Allocation:** How are shared resources managed?
5. **Credit and Recognition:** How are contributions acknowledged?

**Deliverable:** Create a visual representation (flowchart, org chart, process diagram) that shows your governance model.

**Your Facilitation Approach:**

- **Visit each team twice during the 15 minutes**
- **First visit (5-7 min):** Check understanding, clarify scenario details
- **Second visit (10-12 min):** Push thinking with questions:
  - "What happens if this person leaves the project?"
  - "How do you handle a major disagreement using this structure?"
  - "Where might this break down under pressure?"

**Common Challenges and Responses:**

- **Teams default to simple hierarchy** → "What are the downsides of that approach for this scenario?"
- **Teams create overly complex structures** → "How would new team members understand this?"
- **Teams ignore the human dynamics** → "What about trust, communication, relationships?"

#### Gallery Walk and Voting (3 minutes)
**Process:**

1. Teams post their governance designs around the room
2. Everyone walks around and reviews all designs
3. Each person gets 2 dot stickers to vote for:
   - Most innovative approach
   - Most practical for real implementation

**Debrief Questions:**

- "What patterns do you see across the designs?"
- "What creative solutions surprised you?"
- "What would make these governance models actually work in practice?"
