MIT research shows that poor communication costs organizations an average of $62.4 million per year.”\n\n\n4.1.2 The 4C Framework Introduction (3 minutes)\nPresent Framework: “Effective team communication has four essential elements - the 4 C’s:”\nClarity | Cadence | Channels | Culture\n“Let’s unpack each one with some science behind it.”\n\n\n4.1.3 Clarity: Structured Information Sharing (4 minutes)\nResearch Basis: Hackman’s research on team design shows that clarity of purpose and process predicts team success better than member characteristics.\nPractical Application:\n\nMeeting agendas with time allocations\nDecision logs (what was decided, by whom, when)\nAction items with owners and deadlines\nShared glossaries for technical terms across disciplines\n\nDiscussion Prompt: “What happens in your experience when roles or expectations aren’t clear?”\nListen for: Duplicated work, missed deadlines, conflict, frustration\n\n\n4.1.4 Cadence: Regular, Predictable Touchpoints (3 minutes)\nResearch Basis: Gersick’s punctuated equilibrium model shows teams need regular check-ins to maintain momentum and adjust course.\nPractical Framework:\n\nDaily/Weekly: Tactical coordination (brief, operational)\nBi-weekly/Monthly: Strategic review (longer, reflective)\nQuarterly: Relationship maintenance (team building, big picture)\nAs-needed: Crisis management (rapid response protocols)\n\nKey Point: “Consistency matters more than frequency. Better to have monthly meetings that always happen than weekly ones that get cancelled.”\n\n\n4.1.5 Channels: Right Medium for the Message (4 minutes)\nResearch Basis: Media richness theory - different types of information need different communication channels.\nChannel Selection Guide:\n\nFace-to-face/Video: Complex discussions, sensitive topics, brainstorming\nPhone: Quick decisions, relationship building\nEmail: Documentation, detailed information sharing, non-urgent items\nChat/Slack: Quick questions, coordination, social connection\nShared documents: Collaborative creation, version control\n\nCommon Mistake: “Using email for everything. Email is terrible for discussions but great for decisions.”\n\n\n4.1.6 Culture: Psychological Safety and Inclusion (4 minutes)\nResearch Basis: Google’s Project Aristotle found psychological safety was the #1 predictor of team performance.\nEdmondson’s Definition: “A shared belief that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking.”\nObservable Behaviors:\n\nPeople ask questions without fear of appearing ignorant\nMistakes are discussed openly as learning opportunities\nDisagreement is expressed respectfully and directly\nDifferent perspectives are actively sought\n\nKey Insight: “This doesn’t mean being ‘nice’ all the time - it means being direct and kind simultaneously.”",

You’re going to create a communication charter that a real research team could use.”\nMaterials: Provide charter template, example excerpts, channel decision tree\n\n\n4.2.2 Phase 1: Charter Development (10 minutes)\nInstructions to Teams: “Imagine you’re starting a 2-year collaborative research project. Create a communication charter addressing these areas:”\nCharter Elements: 1. Communication Values (3-4 core principles) 2. Meeting Rhythms (frequency, duration, purpose of different meeting types) 3. Channel Guidelines (what goes where, response time expectations) 4. Decision-Making Process (how choices get made, who has input vs. final say) 5. Conflict Resolution (steps for handling disagreements)\nYour Role as Facilitator:\n\nCirculate between teams\nAsk clarifying questions: “How would this work in practice?” “What if someone doesn’t follow this?”\nKeep energy up with time calls\nLook for innovative approaches to highlight\n\nCommon Sticking Points and Responses:\n\n“This is too rigid” → “Think of it as a default, not a rule. You can always deviate with agreement”\n“Our team is different” → “Absolutely - customize this to your context”\n“We don’t have time for all these meetings” → “What’s the cost of poor coordination?”\n\n\n\n4.2.3 Phase 2: Peer Feedback (10 minutes)\nProcess: 1. Teams pair up and exchange charters 2. Each team provides feedback using this structure: - One strength: What works well in this charter? - One question: What needs clarification? - One suggestion: How could this be improved or strengthened?\nFeedback Guidelines to Share:\n\nBe specific rather than general\nFocus on workability, not personal preferences\nAsk questions if something is unclear\n\nYour Role:\n\nMonitor feedback quality - intervene if it’s too vague or harsh\nHelp teams stay on time\nNote particularly creative solutions for later sharing\n\n\n\n4.2.4 Phase 3: Revision (2 minutes)\n“Take the feedback you received and make one concrete revision to your charter.”\nWhy This Matters: Teams that practice giving and receiving feedback in low-stakes situations do better when conflicts arise.",

Let’s look at what research tells us about structures that actually work.”\n\n\n5.1.2 Governance vs. Management Distinction (3 minutes)\nKey Distinction:\n\nManagement: Day-to-day operations, task coordination, resource allocation\nGovernance: Decision rights, accountability structures, conflict resolution, strategic direction\n\nWhy It Matters: “Many teams focus only on management and wonder why they struggle with bigger decisions.”\n\n\n5.1.3 Model 1: Distributed Leadership (4 minutes)\nCore Principle: Different people lead different aspects based on expertise and interest.\nResearch Support: Pearce & Conger’s studies show distributed leadership increases team performance in knowledge work.\nStructure Example:\n\nScientific Leadership: Domain expert guides research direction\nOperational Leadership: Project manager handles logistics, timelines\nExternal Leadership: Senior person manages stakeholder relationships\nInnovation Leadership: Creative thinker drives new approaches\n\nPros: Leverages expertise, develops multiple people, reduces single points of failure Cons: Can be confusing if roles aren’t clear, may slow some decisions\nWhen It Works Best: Diverse, highly skilled teams with complex projects\n\n\n5.1.4 Model 2: Rotating Leadership (3 minutes)\nCore Principle: Leadership rotates based on project phase or expertise needs.\nReal Example: “In the Human Genome Project, different institutions led different phases based on their comparative advantages.”\nStructure Example:\n\nPhase 1: Data collection led by field research expert\nPhase 2: Analysis led by computational specialist\nPhase 3: Dissemination led by policy expert\n\nPros: Matches expertise to needs, develops multiple leaders Cons: Requires smooth handoffs, can create discontinuity\n\n\n5.1.5 Model 3: Collaborative Hierarchy (4 minutes)\nCore Principle: Clear hierarchy with democratic input mechanisms.\nResearch Support: Tannenbaum & Schmidt’s leadership continuum research shows this balances efficiency with engagement.\nStructure Example:\n\nPrincipal Investigator: Final decision authority, external accountability\nAdvisory Council: Representative input from all stakeholder groups\nWorking Groups: Delegated authority for specific domains\n\nDecision Process:\n\nWorking groups develop recommendations\nAdvisory council provides input and alternatives\nPI makes final decision with transparent rationale\n\nPros: Clear accountability, incorporates diverse input, efficient Cons: Can feel top-down if not implemented well\n\n\n5.1.6 Model 4: Network Governance (4 minutes)\nCore Principle: Hub-and-spoke coordination across autonomous units.\nReal Example: “Think of how the Large Hadron Collider collaboration works - thousands of scientists across hundreds of institutions.”\nStructure:\n\nCentral Coordination Hub: Manages overall project, standards, resources\nAutonomous Nodes: Independent teams with specific responsibilities\nLiaison Roles: Boundary spanners who connect nodes\n\nPros: Scales to large collaborations, maintains autonomy Cons: Complex coordination, potential for fragmentation\nKey Success Factor: Strong coordination mechanisms and shared standards",

Site A (major university) has collected data from 500 participants. Site B (smaller college) wants to access this data for secondary analysis.\nRoles (5 people per group):\n\nSite A Principal Investigator: Collected the data, protective of participants\nSite B Researcher: Wants access for legitimate secondary research\nSite A Compliance Officer: Responsible for legal/ethical compliance\nSite B IRB Representative: Must ensure ethical standards\nData Manager: Technical expert on security and systems\n\nKey Constraints:\n\nData includes sensitive mental health information\nParticipants consented to “research by the study team and approved collaborators”\nSite A IRB approval required for data sharing\nSite B has different data security infrastructure\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Negotiation Phase (15 minutes)\nInstructions to Groups: “You have 15 minutes to negotiate a data sharing agreement. You must address these issues:”\nRequired Agreement Elements:\n\nWhat data can be shared? (raw data, processed data, aggregate data only?)\nAccess controls: How will Site B access and store the data?\nPermitted analyses: What research questions can Site B pursue?\nPublication rights: How are publications handled? Authorship?\nSecurity requirements: What technical safeguards are needed?\nCompliance verification: How is adherence to agreement monitored?\n\nYour Facilitation Strategy:\n\nLet tensions emerge naturally - don’t smooth over disagreements too quickly\nIntervene only if discussion becomes personal or completely stuck\nNote common sticking points for debrief discussion\nWatch for creative solutions that balance competing interests\n\nCommon Sticking Points You’ll Observe:\n\nSite A wants extensive oversight, Site B wants autonomy\nPublication timelines and approval processes\nTechnical security requirements vs. practical constraints\nWhat happens if Site B violates the agreement\n\n\n\n6.2.3 Debrief Discussion (7 minutes)\nDebrief Questions:\n\n“What was hardest to negotiate? Why?”\n“What solutions did you find for balancing protection with access?”\n“How did the different perspectives (PI vs. compliance vs. IRB) create tension?”\n“What would make this process easier in real life?”\n\nKey Learning Points to Draw Out:\n\nStart data sharing conversations early in collaboration planning\nDifferent stakeholders have legitimate but competing concerns\nTechnical solutions can resolve some trust issues\nClear agreements prevent bigger conflicts later\n**Templates and institutional support make negotiations faster”\n\nTransition: “Data sharing is often where issues of fairness and inclusion become most visible. Let’s talk about building teams where everyone can contribute effectively.”}",

    "text": "7.1.1 Opening with Evidence (3 minutes)\nResearch Foundation: “Three key findings from team performance research:”\n\nDiverse teams outperform homogeneous teams on complex problems (Page 2007)\nBut diversity alone isn’t enough - inclusion practices determine whether diversity helps or hurts (Nishii 2013)\nSmall changes in process can have big impacts on who participates and how (Woolley 2010)\n\nKey Insight: “Diversity is about composition. Inclusion is about behavior.”\n\n\n7.1.2 Understanding Different Types of Diversity (4 minutes)\nSurface-Level Diversity:\n\nDemographics: gender, race, age, nationality\nDisciplinary backgrounds\nInstitutional affiliations\nCareer stages\n\nDeep-Level Diversity:\n\nThinking styles (analytical vs. intuitive)\nWork preferences (individual vs. collaborative)\nCommunication styles (direct vs. indirect)\nRisk tolerance (conservative vs. experimental)\n\nWhy This Matters: “Surface-level diversity is what we see first, but deep-level diversity often drives the performance benefits.”\n\n\n7.1.3 The Contact Theory Application (3 minutes)\nAllport’s Contact Theory: Under the right conditions, contact between different groups reduces bias and improves collaboration.\nThe Right Conditions for Research Teams:\n\nEqual status within the collaboration context\nCommon goals that require interdependence\nIntergroup contact in cooperative (not competitive) settings\nAuthority support for collaborative norms\n\nPractical Application: “This means actively creating opportunities for different team members to work together as equals on shared objectives.”\n\n\n7.1.4 Inclusion Strategies That Work (5 minutes)\nStrategy 1: Structured Brainstorming\n\nProblem: Extroverted team members dominate idea generation\nSolution: Silent brainstorming → individual sharing → group building\n\nStrategy 2: Devil’s Advocate Protocols\n\nProblem: Pressure for false consensus\nSolution: Assign someone to argue alternative perspectives\n\nStrategy 3: Multiple Communication Channels\n\nProblem: Some people don’t speak up in meetings\nSolution: Combine verbal discussion, written input, and one-on-one check-ins\n\nStrategy 4: Bias Interruption\n\nProblem: Unconscious biases affect evaluation of ideas and contributions\nSolution: Structured evaluation criteria, diverse review panels\n\nStrategy 5: Cultural Bridge-Building\n\nProblem: Different professional cultures have different norms\nSolution: Explicit discussion of differences, negotiated team norms",

Rate how well the team does on each inclusion indicator using a 1-5 scale.”\nInclusion Indicators:\n\nDiverse representation in leadership and decision-making roles\nEquitable participation in meetings and discussions\nMultiple communication styles are accommodated and valued\nDifferent perspectives are actively sought on important decisions\nCultural differences are acknowledged and leveraged as strengths\nBias mitigation strategies are used in evaluation and selection processes\nConflict resolution addresses both task and relationship issues\nRecognition and credit are distributed fairly across contributions\n\nFacilitator Notes:\n\nWalk around but maintain privacy\nNotice if people seem stuck - offer to clarify any indicators\nThis should be reflective, not judgmental\n\n\n\n7.2.2 Pair Planning (10 minutes)\nPartner Assignment: “Find someone you don’t know well or haven’t worked with closely.”\nConversation Structure: Round 1 (3 minutes each person): Share assessment results\n\nWhich areas scored highest? What makes those work well?\nWhich areas scored lowest? What barriers do you see?\nDon’t problem-solve yet - just understand each other’s situations\n\nRound 2 (4 minutes total): Collaborative action planning\n\nChoose 2-3 priority areas for improvement\nBrainstorm specific, actionable strategies\nConsider: What would you try first? What support would you need?\n\nFacilitation Approach: - Circulate to listen for innovative ideas - Help pairs stay focused on actionable steps - Note themes for whole-group debrief\nCommon Challenges and Responses:\n\n“Our team is already pretty inclusive” → “That’s great! What could you share with other teams?”\n“These problems are too big for me to solve” → “What’s one small experiment you could try?”\n“I’m not in a leadership position” → “What can you influence from your current role?”",
