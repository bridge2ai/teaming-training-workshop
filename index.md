# Team Science Training Workshop

## Workshop Overview

Welcome to the Team Science Training Workshop! This comprehensive program is designed to help research teams collaborate more effectively through evidence-based practices and structured frameworks.

## Workshop Goals

This training workshop aims to equip participants with the knowledge, skills, and tools needed to:

### 1. Understand Team Science Fundamentals
- Learn what makes research teams effective based on scientific evidence
- Identify common failure modes in collaborative research
- Apply the IMPACT framework (Interdependence, Motivation, Processes, Abilities, Culture, Tools) to team dynamics

### 2. Build Communication Architecture
- Implement the 4C Framework (Clarity, Cadence, Channels, Culture) for effective team communication
- Create communication charters that work for real research teams
- Establish psychological safety and inclusion norms

### 3. Design Governance Structures
- Understand different leadership models (distributed, rotating, collaborative hierarchy, network governance)
- Design governance structures appropriate for specific collaboration contexts
- Create clear decision-making processes and accountability structures

### 4. Manage Data and Resources Collaboratively
- Apply FAIR+ principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable, Secure) to team data practices
- Negotiate data sharing agreements that balance protection with access
- Establish protocols for resource allocation and management

### 5. Build Inclusive and Productive Teams
- Recognize the value of diversity in research teams
- Implement inclusion strategies that enable all team members to contribute effectively
- Address bias and create equitable participation structures

### 6. Implement Sustainable Practices
- Develop personal action plans for improving team collaboration
- Start with small, measurable changes that demonstrate value
- Build accountability and support systems for sustained improvement

## Training Format

The workshop consists of six interactive modules combining:

- **Evidence-based content:** Research findings on team effectiveness

- **Action planning:** Concrete steps for implementation

## Target Audience

This training is designed for:

- Research team members at all career stages
- Principal investigators leading collaborative projects
- Project managers and coordinators
- Anyone involved in multi-institutional or interdisciplinary research

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of this workshop, participants will:

- Have a clear understanding of what makes research teams succeed or struggle
- Possess practical frameworks and tools for improving team collaboration
- Have developed personal action plans for implementing specific practices
- Be connected with peers for ongoing learning and support
