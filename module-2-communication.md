# Module 2: Communication Architecture (45 minutes)

## Content Block: Evidence-Based Communication Strategies (20 minutes)

### Opening Bridge (2 minutes)
**Say:** "In that last activity, how many groups mentioned communication as a challenge?" [Show of hands] "Communication issues aren't just annoying - they're expensive. MIT research shows that poor communication costs organizations an average of $62.4 million per year."

### The 4C Framework Introduction (3 minutes)
**Present Framework:**
"Effective team communication has four essential elements - the 4 C's:"

**Clarity | Cadence | Channels | Culture**

"Let's unpack each one with some science behind it."

### Clarity: Structured Information Sharing (4 minutes)
**Research Basis:** Hackman's research on team design shows that clarity of purpose and process predicts team success better than member characteristics.

**Practical Application:**

- **Meeting agendas with time allocations**
- **Decision logs** (what was decided, by whom, when)
- **Action items with owners and deadlines**
- **Shared glossaries** for technical terms across disciplines

**Discussion Prompt:** "What happens in your experience when roles or expectations aren't clear?"

**Listen for:** Duplicated work, missed deadlines, conflict, frustration

### Cadence: Regular, Predictable Touchpoints (3 minutes)
**Research Basis:** Gersick's punctuated equilibrium model shows teams need regular check-ins to maintain momentum and adjust course.

**Practical Framework:**

- **Daily/Weekly:** Tactical coordination (brief, operational)
- **Bi-weekly/Monthly:** Strategic review (longer, reflective)
- **Quarterly:** Relationship maintenance (team building, big picture)
- **As-needed:** Crisis management (rapid response protocols)

**Key Point:** "Consistency matters more than frequency. Better to have monthly meetings that always happen than weekly ones that get cancelled."

### Channels: Right Medium for the Message (4 minutes)
**Research Basis:** Media richness theory - different types of information need different communication channels.

**Channel Selection Guide:**

- **Face-to-face/Video:** Complex discussions, sensitive topics, brainstorming
- **Phone:** Quick decisions, relationship building
- **Email:** Documentation, detailed information sharing, non-urgent items
- **Chat/Slack:** Quick questions, coordination, social connection
- **Shared documents:** Collaborative creation, version control

**Common Mistake:** "Using email for everything. Email is terrible for discussions but great for decisions."

### Culture: Psychological Safety and Inclusion (4 minutes)
**Research Basis:** Google's Project Aristotle found psychological safety was the #1 predictor of team performance.

**Edmondson's Definition:** "A shared belief that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking."

**Observable Behaviors:**

- People ask questions without fear of appearing ignorant
- Mistakes are discussed openly as learning opportunities
- Disagreement is expressed respectfully and directly
- Different perspectives are actively sought

**Key Insight:** "This doesn't mean being 'nice' all the time - it means being direct and kind simultaneously."

## Activity 2: Communication Charter Workshop (25 minutes)

### Setup and Instructions (3 minutes)
**Form Teams:** "Count off 1-5, find your number group. You're going to create a communication charter that a real research team could use."

**Materials:** Provide charter template, example excerpts, channel decision tree

### Phase 1: Charter Development (10 minutes)
**Instructions to Teams:**
"Imagine you're starting a 2-year collaborative research project. Create a communication charter addressing these areas:"

**Charter Elements:**
1. **Communication Values** (3-4 core principles)
2. **Meeting Rhythms** (frequency, duration, purpose of different meeting types)
3. **Channel Guidelines** (what goes where, response time expectations)
4. **Decision-Making Process** (how choices get made, who has input vs. final say)
5. **Conflict Resolution** (steps for handling disagreements)

**Your Role as Facilitator:**

- Circulate between teams
- Ask clarifying questions: "How would this work in practice?" "What if someone doesn't follow this?"
- Keep energy up with time calls
- Look for innovative approaches to highlight

**Common Sticking Points and Responses:**

- **"This is too rigid"** → "Think of it as a default, not a rule. You can always deviate with agreement"
- **"Our team is different"** → "Absolutely - customize this to your context"
- **"We don't have time for all these meetings"** → "What's the cost of poor coordination?"

### Phase 2: Peer Feedback (10 minutes)
**Process:**
1. Teams pair up and exchange charters
2. Each team provides feedback using this structure:
   - **One strength:** What works well in this charter?
   - **One question:** What needs clarification?
   - **One suggestion:** How could this be improved or strengthened?

**Feedback Guidelines to Share:**

- Be specific rather than general
- Focus on workability, not personal preferences
- Ask questions if something is unclear

**Your Role:**

- Monitor feedback quality - intervene if it's too vague or harsh
- Help teams stay on time
- Note particularly creative solutions for later sharing

### Phase 3: Revision (2 minutes)
"Take the feedback you received and make one concrete revision to your charter."

**Why This Matters:** Teams that practice giving and receiving feedback in low-stakes situations do better when conflicts arise.
