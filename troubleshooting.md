# Troubleshooting Common Facilitation Challenges

### Low Participation
**Symptoms:** Quiet groups, minimal discussion, brief activity outputs
**Interventions:**

- Use smaller groups (3-4 people)
- Provide more structure and specific prompts
- Model vulnerability by sharing your own experiences
- Use anonymous input methods (sticky notes, digital polls)

### Resistance to "Soft Skills"
**Symptoms:** Comments like "This is just common sense" or "We need to focus on the science"
**Responses:**

- Lead with data and evidence
- Connect to concrete research outcomes
- Share failure stories from high-profile collaborations
- Acknowledge their expertise while highlighting collaboration complexity

### Time Management Issues
**Symptoms:** Activities running long, content blocks getting rushed
**Solutions:**

- Use visible timers for all activities
- Give time warnings (5 minutes, 2 minutes, wrap up)
- Have abbreviated versions of activities ready
- Cut content, not activities - the practice is more valuable

### Dominating Participants
**Symptoms:** Same people speaking repeatedly, others withdrawing
**Interventions:**

- Use structured turn-taking ("Each person shares one idea")
- Redirect: "Thank you, John. Sarah, what's your perspective?"
- Address privately during breaks if necessary
- Use written activities to balance participation

### Skepticism About Evidence
**Symptoms:** "That research doesn't apply to our field/situation"
**Responses:**

- Ask for specific context that makes it different
- Find research from their discipline if possible
- Focus on principles rather than specific practices
- Invite them to test and report back

### Technology Failures
**Symptoms:** Platform crashes, connectivity issues, lost materials
**Preparation:**

- Have low-tech backup plans for all activities
- Test technology multiple times before session
- Prepare printed materials as backup
- Designate a tech support person if possible
