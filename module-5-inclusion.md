# Module 5: Building Inclusive and Productive Teams (30 minutes)

## Content Block: Diversity, Equity, and Team Performance (15 minutes)

### Opening with Evidence (3 minutes)
**Research Foundation:** "Three key findings from team performance research:"

1. **Diverse teams outperform homogeneous teams** on complex problems (Page 2007)
2. **But diversity alone isn't enough** - inclusion practices determine whether diversity helps or hurts (Nishii 2013)
3. **Small changes in process can have big impacts** on who participates and how (Woolley 2010)

**Key Insight:** "Diversity is about composition. Inclusion is about behavior."

### Understanding Different Types of Diversity (4 minutes)
**Surface-Level Diversity:**

- Demographics: gender, race, age, nationality
- Disciplinary backgrounds
- Institutional affiliations
- Career stages

**Deep-Level Diversity:**

- Thinking styles (analytical vs. intuitive)
- Work preferences (individual vs. collaborative)
- Communication styles (direct vs. indirect)
- Risk tolerance (conservative vs. experimental)

**Why This Matters:** "Surface-level diversity is what we see first, but deep-level diversity often drives the performance benefits."

### The Contact Theory Application (3 minutes)
**Allport's Contact Theory:** Under the right conditions, contact between different groups reduces bias and improves collaboration.

**The Right Conditions for Research Teams:**

1. **Equal status** within the collaboration context
2. **Common goals** that require interdependence
3. **Intergroup contact** in cooperative (not competitive) settings
4. **Authority support** for collaborative norms

**Practical Application:** "This means actively creating opportunities for different team members to work together as equals on shared objectives."

### Inclusion Strategies That Work (5 minutes)
**Strategy 1: Structured Brainstorming**

- **Problem:** Extroverted team members dominate idea generation
- **Solution:** Silent brainstorming → individual sharing → group building

**Strategy 2: Devil's Advocate Protocols**

- **Problem:** Pressure for false consensus
- **Solution:** Assign someone to argue alternative perspectives

**Strategy 3: Multiple Communication Channels**

- **Problem:** Some people don't speak up in meetings
- **Solution:** Combine verbal discussion, written input, and one-on-one check-ins

**Strategy 4: Bias Interruption**

- **Problem:** Unconscious biases affect evaluation of ideas and contributions
- **Solution:** Structured evaluation criteria, diverse review panels

**Strategy 5: Cultural Bridge-Building**

- **Problem:** Different professional cultures have different norms
- **Solution:** Explicit discussion of differences, negotiated team norms

## Activity 5: Inclusion Audit and Action Planning (15 minutes)

### Individual Assessment (5 minutes)
**Instructions:** "Think about a current or recent research collaboration. Rate how well the team does on each inclusion indicator using a 1-5 scale."

**Inclusion Indicators:**

1. **Diverse representation** in leadership and decision-making roles
2. **Equitable participation** in meetings and discussions
3. **Multiple communication styles** are accommodated and valued
4. **Different perspectives** are actively sought on important decisions
5. **Cultural differences** are acknowledged and leveraged as strengths
6. **Bias mitigation** strategies are used in evaluation and selection processes
7. **Conflict resolution** addresses both task and relationship issues
8. **Recognition and credit** are distributed fairly across contributions

**Facilitator Notes:**

- Walk around but maintain privacy
- Notice if people seem stuck - offer to clarify any indicators
- This should be reflective, not judgmental

### Pair Planning (10 minutes)
**Partner Assignment:** "Find someone you don't know well or haven't worked with closely."

**Conversation Structure:**
**Round 1 (3 minutes each person):** Share assessment results

- Which areas scored highest? What makes those work well?
- Which areas scored lowest? What barriers do you see?
- Don't problem-solve yet - just understand each other's situations

**Round 2 (4 minutes total):** Collaborative action planning

- Choose 2-3 priority areas for improvement
- Brainstorm specific, actionable strategies
- Consider: What would you try first? What support would you need?

**Facilitation Approach:**
- Circulate to listen for innovative ideas
- Help pairs stay focused on actionable steps
- Note themes for whole-group debrief

**Common Challenges and Responses:**

- **"Our team is already pretty inclusive"** → "That's great! What could you share with other teams?"
- **"These problems are too big for me to solve"** → "What's one small experiment you could try?"
- **"I'm not in a leadership position"** → "What can you influence from your current role?"
