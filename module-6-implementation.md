# Module 6: Implementation and Sustainability (20 minutes)

## Content Block: Making It Stick (10 minutes)

### The Implementation Challenge (2 minutes)
**Reality Check:** "Research on training effectiveness shows that without deliberate implementation support, people use about 10% of what they learn in programs like this."

**Why Implementation Fails:**
- Return to urgent daily pressures
- Lack of organizational support
- Trying to change too much at once
- No accountability mechanisms

### The Start Small Strategy (3 minutes)
**Pilot Approach:** "Pick one practice, try it with one team, for one month."

**Examples of Good Starting Points:**

- **Communication:** Implement structured agendas for one regular meeting
- **Governance:** Create decision logs for one ongoing project
- **Data sharing:** Establish naming conventions for one shared folder
- **Inclusion:** Try silent brainstorming in one team meeting

**Why This Works:** Small wins build confidence and demonstrate value before scaling up.

### Measurement and Iteration (2 minutes)
**Simple Metrics for Team Effectiveness:**

- **Efficiency:** Meeting satisfaction scores, time to decision
- **Innovation:** Number of new ideas generated, creative solutions adopted
- **Relationships:** Trust levels, conflict resolution speed
- **Outcomes:** Progress toward goals, quality of deliverables

**The Learning Mindset:** "Expect that your first attempts won't be perfect. The goal is to learn and improve, not to implement flawlessly."

### Scaling Thoughtfully (3 minutes)
**Scaling Principles:**

1. **Adapt, don't just adopt:** What works for one team may need modification for another
2. **Build champions:** Find early adopters, preferably respected individuals with formal or informal influence, who can help spread practices
3. **Communicate, communicate, communicate:** what you’re planning and why; what you’re doing when you’re doing it; and what you’ve done, how it went, and what you will do differently
4. **Create systems support:** Templates, training, and infrastructure
5. **Address resistance:** Understand and respond to legitimate concerns; treat resistance as an opportunity for potential learning; often most productive to persuade fence-sitters first

**Common Scaling Mistakes:**

- Mandating practices without buy-in
- Insufficient communication
- Ignoring context differences
- Moving too fast without solidifying early wins

## Activity 6: Personal Action Planning (10 minutes)

### Action Planning Template (8 minutes)
**Instructions:** "Complete this action plan for yourself. Be specific and realistic."

**Template Elements:**
1. **One thing I'll stop doing** in my research collaborations
   - *Example: Stop sending unclear emails that require multiple follow-ups*

2. **One thing I'll start doing** within the next 30 days
   - *Example: Create a communication charter for my current project team*

3. **One practice I'll advocate for** in my existing teams
   - *Example: Propose using structured brainstorming for our next planning meeting*

4. **My accountability partner** from this session
   - *Name and contact information of someone who will check in with you*

5. **Check-in date** to assess progress
   - *Specific date within 60 days to review how implementation is going*

6. **One resource I need** to make this work
   - *Example: Template for data sharing agreements, support from my department chair*

**Facilitator Role:**

- Circulate to answer questions and provide encouragement
- Help people make their commitments specific and measurable
- Connect people who might be good accountability partners

### Voluntary Sharing (2 minutes)
**Process:** "Would anyone like to share one commitment with the group? This can help with accountability."

**Why This Works:** Public commitments have higher follow-through rates.

**Facilitation Tips:**

- Don't pressure anyone to share
- Celebrate creative or ambitious commitments
- Note themes across commitments
