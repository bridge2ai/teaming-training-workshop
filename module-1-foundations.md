# Module 1: Foundations of Team Science (30 minutes)

## Content Block: What Makes Teams Work (15 minutes)

### Opening Hook (3 minutes)
**Say:** "Raise your hand if you've ever been part of a research collaboration that felt effortless and productive." [Pause for hands] "Keep your hand up if you've been part of one that was frustrating or unproductive." [Usually more hands go up]

**Transition:** "Today we're going to unpack why some collaborations soar while others struggle, using evidence from the science of team science itself."

### Key Message 1: The Collaboration Imperative (4 minutes)
**Data to Share:**

- 2007 study of 19.9 million papers showed teams produce higher-impact research
- Nobel Prize data: 42% of physics prizes since 2000 went to collaborations
- NIH success rates higher for multi-PI grants in many programs

**Discussion Prompt:** "What drives this trend toward collaboration in your field?"

**Listen for:** Complexity of problems, resource needs, interdisciplinary requirements, technology demands

**Bridge:** "But collaboration isn't automatically better - it has to be done well."

### Key Message 2: When Teams Fail (4 minutes)
**Common Failure Modes (present as bullets on slide):**

- **Coordination loss:** Too much time spent organizing, not enough creating
- **Social loafing:** Some members contribute less in group settings
- **Groupthink:** Pressure for consensus stifles critical thinking
- **Process conflict:** Disagreements about how to work together
- **Goal misalignment:** Different objectives or success metrics

**Facilitator Note:** Don't dwell on failures - this sets up the solution-focused content ahead.

### Key Message 3: Success Factors (4 minutes)
**The IMPACT Framework:**

- **I**nterdependence: Members need each other to succeed
- **M**otivation: Shared purpose and individual engagement
- **P**rocesses: Clear workflows and communication protocols
- **A**bilities: Complementary skills and expertise
- **C**ulture: Trust, psychological safety, inclusion norms
- **T**ools: Infrastructure for collaboration and data sharing

**Facilitator Tip:** This framework threads through the entire training - refer back to it throughout.

## Activity 1: Team Science Assessment (15 minutes)

### Individual Reflection (5 minutes)
**Instructions to Give:**
"Think of a research collaboration you've been part of - current or recent. Rate it on these six dimensions using a 1-5 scale, where 1 is 'major weakness' and 5 is 'major strength.' Be honest - this is for your learning."

**Dimensions to Rate:**

1. **Clear shared goals:** Everyone understood what we were trying to achieve
2. **Complementary expertise:** Team had the right mix of skills and knowledge
3. **Effective communication:** Information flowed well, meetings were productive
4. **Equitable participation:** All voices were heard, contributions were valued
5. **Conflict resolution:** We handled disagreements constructively
6. **Resource sharing:** Data, materials, and tools were accessible to team members

**Facilitator Actions:**

- Walk around, but don't look over shoulders
- Give 1-minute and 30-second warnings
- Model reflection by jotting your own notes

### Small Group Discussion (10 minutes)
**Instructions:**
"Form groups of 4-5. Each person shares:
1. One area where your team was strongest (highest score)
2. One area that was most challenging (lowest score)
3. Don't name the team or people - focus on the dynamics"

**Your Role:**

- Visit each group briefly, listen for patterns
- Note common strengths and challenges on your notepad
- Prepare to synthesize themes in debrief

**Listen for These Patterns:**

- **Strengths:** Often include shared excitement about the problem, clear expertise divisions, strong PI leadership
- **Challenges:** Frequently communication breakdowns, unclear roles, data sharing difficulties, conflict avoidance

### Debrief (5 minutes)
**Process:**

1. "What themes did you hear in your groups about team strengths?"
2. "What about common challenges?"
3. Capture responses on flipchart/screen
4. "Great - we're going to address many of these challenges directly in our time together"

**Transition:** "Let's start with one of the most commonly cited issues: communication."
