# Pre-Session Preparation

## Room Setup
**In-Person:**

- Tables for 4-6 people (collaborative seating)
- Wall space for posting flipchart sheets
- Supplies: markers, sticky notes, timer, flipchart paper
- Name tags with first names only

**Virtual:**

- Pre-configured breakout rooms (4-5 people each)
- Shared collaboration tool (Miro, Jamboard, or Padlet)
- Polls/surveys ready in platform
- Chat moderation plan

## Facilitator Mindset

- **You're a guide, not a guru:** Your science expertise gives you credibility, but participants' experiences drive learning
- **Embrace productive discomfort:** Some activities may feel unfamiliar - that's intentional
- **Model vulnerability:** Share your own collaboration challenges when appropriate
